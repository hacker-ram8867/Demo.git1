üêç Python Malware Simulation (For Practice & Learning)
This project is a basic malware simulation written in Python, designed purely for educational and ethical hacking practice. It demonstrates how simple scripts can mimic malicious behavior such as file duplication, fake error messages, or system info logging. The code does not harm the system and is intended for offline environments or sandboxes only.
It helps beginners understand:

How malware might interact with files

How social engineering tricks users

Why antivirus detection matters
